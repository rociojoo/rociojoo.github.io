title: "About me"
---


  * I do research in movement ecology, and before I worked with fishing vessel movement. I implement and develop tools to understand the drivers of movement. As a statistician, I am very much interested in models and equations, but I'm also interested in the applications: I want my research to be a contribution to the understanding of life. 

  * Currently I'm a postdoctoral research associate at University of Florida since 2018, as a movement ecologist.
  
  * I'm Peruvian, studied and worked in France and now I'm in South Florida. I also travel a lot. I always take with me: my roots, everything I've learned from different cultures and amazing people, openness to learn more and to be surprised, and, whenever I can, a percussion instrument.
